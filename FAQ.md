# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Could you support more shells?

It is a conscious decision to only support Bash and Zsh. Previous versions of the workflow supported more shells and those were a pain to manage, each with their own idiosyncrasies. Because they are not standard, a bunch of trickery is necessary to completely isolate them. Debugging becomes particularly troublesome and not worth it for a tiny percentage of users.

### How do I report an issue?

Accurate and thorough information is crucial for a proper diagnosis. **At a minimum, your report should include:**

* The [debugger](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/debugger/) output of the failing action.
* Your installed versions of: the Workflow, Alfred, and macOS. *Be precise, don’t say “latest”.*
